  <h2> Self-driving car dataset: </h2>
  <h4>1: Udacity Self Driving Car Dataset 3-1: El Camino</h4>
  <p style="text-align: justify-all;">Dataset of two drives from the Udacity office to San Francisco up (and down) El Camino Real, the path of the final drive and where the test sets of Challenges 2 & 3 will take place. Sunny afternoon and evening drives, an attempt was made to stay in the same lane, but obstacles and construction sometimes required lane changes. While this is an official dataset for Challenge 3, it has all required information to be used in Challenge 2. Note, only the center camera feed will be available in the test set. Also, this dataset includes Velodyne VLP-16 LIDAR packets. This is so that you may see the format of the LIDAR we will be publishing, but it is not useful (or allowed) in Challenges 2&3.</p>
