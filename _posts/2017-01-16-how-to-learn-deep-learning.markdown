I oscillated between different blogs and videos to become a deep learning practitioner. This blog is to document my learning and to follow an optimal path to become Deep Learning practioner faster

## It is all about Math

Don't be shy if you haven't brushed your Math skills for a while. When you are programming for while bad habits creep in , it takes time to unlearn and learn new things. I had a tough time initially then started refreshing my Math again. I used Khan academy , i like how most of the sessions are only 10 minutes long. I followed below order

1. [Algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home) -- Yes you have to refresh Algebra. Remember the equation for straight line y = mx + b. That is the best equation you learned in your life. Most of machine learning is about finding the value of "m" called weights and "b" called biases.
2. [Trigonometry](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/trigonometry)
3. [Differential Calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/mission/differential-calculus) -- Machine Learning/Deep Learning is all about finding slope aka derivatives, hence do it thoroughly
4. [Partial Differential Equations](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/differential-equations)
4. [Integral Calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/mission/integral-calculus)
5. [Probability and Statistics](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability) -- this is important for anything in Machine Learning.
6. [Linear Algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra) -- Most of calculations are done using Matrix multiplication, dot products, transpose so learn this well.
7. Linear Algebra Advanced -- Yes it is that important. I referred to Prof Gilbert Strang [lectures](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/video-lectures/) from MIT.

## Intro into Machine Learning

I took Prof Andrew Ng's Coursera [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) course in 2012. It is the bible if you are starting with Machine Learning. Take your time and learn the basics.  


## Mining Massive Datasets

This was one of the [best courses](http://online.stanford.edu/Mining_Massive_Datasets_Fall_2014) i took, it helped me to understand Mathematical intuition behind lot of Machine Learning algorithms.

## Deep Learning

This course is Math heavy, but Prof Ali Ghodsi [lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyAZszlPphs&list=PLehuLRPyt1Hyi78UOkMPWCGRxGcA9NVOE) explains it well. It is one of the hidden gems there are quite a series of lectures in youtube, watch it all. Watch it in loop, till you get hang of every concept.


## Convolution Neural Networks

Convolution Neural networks is a class of Deep Learning that is predominantly used for computer vision. AndreJ Karpathy and Justin Johnson taught a great course [cs231n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-PvXUjD6qg&list=PLlJy-eBtNFt6EuMxFYRiNRS07MCWN5UIA) in Stanford on CNN. It gives lot of practical tips on building Deep Learning models.
I wrote an intro level CNN tutorial for [Keras](https://github.com/malaikannan/Talks/blob/master/Demystifying_AI_Keras_Intro.ipynb).


## Natural Language processing

Richard Socher's class on Natural Language processing is must if you want to work on Unstructured text. [CS224d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy0oEkCZkBI&list=PLlJy-eBtNFt4CSVWYqscHDdP58M3zFHIG) is heavy on Recurrent Neural Networks. Recently [Convolution Neural Networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzSPZyjGlWI&t=517s) are being used more for NLP.


## Learn Python

Python is becoming a de-facto language for scientific and numerical computation. Most Deep Learning libraries have a python front end. If you are new to python then use [Byte of Python](https://python.swaroopch.com/) book to learn. There are lot of good youtube tutorials too.


## GPU's

If you have managed to take all these classes mentioned in the list above, then you are a serious about being a Deep Learning practitioner. Invest in a good NVIDIA GPU for trying out different models. You can use AWS for training but you will end up spending lot of money to train different models, in a long run it will make sense to buy your own hardware. Hey you can use it for gaming too, if you feel bored about Deep Learning.

## Must Buy/Read Books

Ian GoodFellow, Aaron CourVille, and Yoshua Bengio wrote an awesome [Deep Learning Book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/). I bought it, since it is a text-book theory book.
Another book i often referred to is [Neural Networks and DeepLearning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/). This book explains [Backpropagation]((http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap2.html), one of the most important concepts in deep learning very well.

## Blogs to Read

I read [Machine Learning Mastery](http://machinelearningmastery.com/), it has practical tips and good blogs.

## Deep Learning Frameworks

There are quite a few options when it comes to Deep Learning frameworks

1. Tensorflow
2. Theano
3. Keras
4. Caffe
5. CNTK
6. Lasagne
7. Other

I am personally big fan of Keras (wrapper over Tensorflow and Theano), since it abstracts lot of complexity of building a Deep Learning model, i can build a model and test whether it works or not very fast. There are tons of online tutorials on Tensorflow and Theano.

Gokul Krishnan wrote a really good blog on [Anatomy of Deep Learning Frameworks](https://medium.com/@gokul_uf/the-anatomy-of-deep-learning-frameworks-46e2a7af5e47#.qp4zrn6s6)

## Kaggle

[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) is a data science competition forum, lot of researchers compete there and share their approach they used for solving that problem. Compete actively to learn and improve.

## Follow Researchers on Twitter

I used twitter recommendation engine (learning machine learning using machine learning) to keep myself updated with latest research papers. Check whom i am following , on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/malai_san)
